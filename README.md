# Power System Analysis Lab

This repository contains two works from the Power System Analysis Lab works which are : 
* [Formation of Bus Admittance and Node Elimination](https://github.com/Iftu119/PowerSystemLab/blob/main/1_BusAdmittance_Node_Elimination.m)
* [Load flow analysis by Gauss Seidel Method](https://github.com/Iftu119/PowerSystemLab/blob/main/2_Gauss_Seidel_based_Calculation.m)

  ## Description
  Both this works are performed on Matlab and can help understand load flow analysis better. <br>
  Considering the similarity between both the works,
