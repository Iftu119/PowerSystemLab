# Power System Analysis Lab

This repository contains two works from the Power System Analysis Lab works which are : 
* [Formation of Bus Admittance and Node Elimination](https://github.com/Iftu119/PowerSystemLab/blob/main/1_BusAdmittance_Node_Elimination.m)
* [Load flow analysis by Gauss Seidel Method](https://github.com/Iftu119/PowerSystemLab/blob/main/2_Gauss_Seidel_based_Calculation.m)

## Description
Both this works are performed on Matlab and can help understand load flow analysis better. <br>
Considering the similarity between both the works, the 1st code contains **comments in Bengali (à¦¬à¦¾à¦‚à¦²à¦¾)ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡©** while the 2nd one is in regular English.
<br> <br>
Problem-2 has been shared below for easier reference.
